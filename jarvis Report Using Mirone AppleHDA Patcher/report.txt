Found "Device (HDEF)" in DSDT.aml
Found property "layout-id" in DSDT.aml
Found 1 occurennces of "layout-id" in ioreg, not sure what's will be for HDEF..
Found unsupported "layout-id = 11" in ioreg, will not work using Mirone's patches!!!
No "Device (HDAU)" was found inside your ACPI tables. That is normal w/o a PCI Video card or w/o an HDMI connector on it!

AppleHDA Patcher.app only supports (if patched by Mirone):
layout-id 2 for laptop's,
layout-id 5 for Desktop's with 3 connectors (pink, green and blue),
layout-id 7 for Desktop's with 5/6 connectors (gray, black, orange, pink, green and blue),
layout-id 9 for Desktop's with 5/6 connectors (gray, black, orange, pink, green, blue, CodecAddress:2)

aDummyHDA.kext works only is /System/Library/Extensions.
Laptop's may be need the provided ACPI Patch such system_IRQ.txt to be functional.
HDAEnabler.kext maybe usefull if you don't want to edit your ACPI table or the Clover's config,
or the org.Chameleon.Boot.plist.
CodecCommander.kext is usefull in the case you have no sound after waking from sleep.

Generated kexts should be installed in a proper way, repairing its permissions and rebuilding the cache:
dragging kexts into Pandora's Box.app window will help you to do that!
